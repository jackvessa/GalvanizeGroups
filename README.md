## Project Motivation

- Educators have countless tasks to complete and very limited time to do so. 
- This project aims to tackle the very important (and very time consuming) task of effectively grouping students. 
- Providing educators with a simple tool to create groups of students using insights driven by data can help them spend more time planning engaging lessons and creating personalized education experiences.

## Grouping Considerations and inputs

CSV File
```
Teachers can upload a CSV file with student names and assignment scores
```
Section ID
```
Because a CSV file may have multiple sections, teachers can specify which section to group
```
Number of Groups
```
Teachers can choose any number of groups to create!
```
Type of Grouping
```
Teachers can choose Homogenous (similar scores) or Heterogeneous (different scores) grouping
```

## How it Works
